# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Information

This Java-based Tic Tac Toe game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The game automatically checks for a win, loss, or draw after each move and keeps track of each player's score. Players can reset the game to start a new round or exit at any time through the user interface.
